This wraps the manage command and works better for vim and omnicomplete. I plan on actively adding features as I use it. This is still really early in development just trying to bring a small working version out.
If there is a feature you would like vim to do with django feel free to make an issue on github or email me.



I recommend installing through vundle/pathogen.
